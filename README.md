## Nakama GameCreator
An extension that adds a handful of actions, conditions and triggers to GameCreator that allow you to use Nakama in your game.
#### What is Nakama?
Nakama is an open source game backend which can be self-hosted or hosted directly by Heroic Labs. Nakama is highly scalable and allows to handle a large amount of data. If you don't know Nakama yet [check it out here](https://heroiclabs.com/). I won't go into the functionality of Nakama itself. To use the extension you should have a basic knowledge of Nakama.
## Requirements
Since this is an extension for existing plugins a few dependencies are required.

 - [GameCreator - by Catsoft Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-89443)
 - [Nakama - by Heroic Labs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/nakama-81338)

## How to Use
To use the Nakama GameCreator Actions, Conditions and Triggers the scene must contain the NakamaManager.cs.
This provides basic functions and connects you to the Nakama server of your choice.
Everything else you can see via the GameCreator category "Nakama".
*At a later time I will go into the individual actions in more detail.*

## Note
The extension is currently under development and will be used for my own project. I will try to update the repository regularly, but I can't guarantee that.
