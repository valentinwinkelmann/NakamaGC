## 🏠Nakama GameCreator Integration - ⚠ Work in process
An extension that adds a handful of actions, conditions and triggers to GameCreator that allow you to use Nakama in your game.

*This extension is absolutely not suitable for production environment and is heavily in work. Make a backup of your project before using the extension.*
#### ⁉What is Nakama?
Nakama is an open source game backend which can be self-hosted or hosted directly by Heroic Labs. Nakama is highly scalable and allows to handle a large amount of data. If you don't know Nakama yet [check it out here](https://heroiclabs.com/). I won't go into the functionality of Nakama itself. To use the extension you should have a basic knowledge of Nakama.
## 🔌Compatibility
Nakama and GameCreator are available for all major platforms, including WebGL.
So I try to support this extension on all popular platforms. I use Unity 2020.2.1f1 myself, but it should be backwards compatible. Until where I can not say exactly. Test for this will follow...
## 📄Requirements
Since this is an extension for existing plugins a few dependencies are required.

 - [GameCreator - by Catsoft Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-89443)
 - [Nakama - by Heroic Labs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/nakama-81338)

## 🛠How to Use
To use the Nakama GameCreator Actions, Conditions and Triggers the scene must contain the NakamaManager.cs.
This provides basic functions and connects you to the Nakama server of your choice.
Everything else you can see via the GameCreator category "Nakama".

## 🐞Error reporting and feature requests.
The whole plugin is currently under construction. It is absolutely not suitable for a production environment and I can't give a time schedule when it will be. But if you want to test the plugin already, you can post any problems or feature requests in the issue section.
## 🖊Note
The extension is currently under development and will be used for my own project. I will try to update the repository regularly, but I can't guarantee that.
